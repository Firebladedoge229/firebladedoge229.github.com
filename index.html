    <p style="padding-top: 82px;" id="aboutText">My name is Fireblade, as you can probably tell by my username. I script a lot of the time on a program called Roblox Studio. It's fun, you should really try it out!. I make games sometimes but most of them end up going nowhere and are prototypes. Other than scripting with Roblox Studio, I like to code using HTML  and CSS sometimes, like making a Stylus theme for a website. I am a beginner at Python, really good with Lua / Luau, and Intermediate with HTML and Javascript. Other than that, theres really nothing else to say. Thanks for coming to my website!</p>
